>> To complete your coding assignments using the GitHub Codespaces platform in MindTap, you will have to authorize GitHub to access your MindTap course. Note, you will only have to do this once when you launch the first Coding Lab assignment at the beginning of your semester. In order to complete this authorization process, you will need to have a GitHub account. You can use your existing GitHub account or go to github.com to sign up for one. As you launch your first coding assignment in MindTap, the authorization screen will pop up. Select the green button to link your GitHub account with your MindTap course. Your account is now authorized and you can begin your assignments.

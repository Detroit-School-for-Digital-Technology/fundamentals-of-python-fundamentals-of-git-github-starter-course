The tasks describe the lab
objectives you need to complete.

00:00:03.326 --> 00:00:05.896 A:middle
They usually include a series
of checks which are run

00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:09.136 A:middle
against your project to ensure
each task has been completed.

00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:11.806 A:middle
To verify you have
fulfilled a specific task,

00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:14.136 A:middle
select the grey box
next to that task.

00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:17.436 A:middle
If the box appears red, it
means the task requirement was

00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:18.296 A:middle
not fulfilled.

00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:21.526 A:middle
A green box indicates a
successfully completed task.

00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:24.156 A:middle
If you want to check
all the tasks at once,

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:25.986 A:middle
select Calculate Grade.

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:28.806 A:middle
This will provide you with
an overview of your progress,

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:31.186 A:middle
completion status,
and your current grade

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:33.146 A:middle
for all the tasks
in the assignment.

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:36.166 A:middle
Select the Submit button
at the bottom of the pane

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.986 A:middle
to send the grades to your
instructor once you have

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:40.946 A:middle
sufficiently completed
all tasks.

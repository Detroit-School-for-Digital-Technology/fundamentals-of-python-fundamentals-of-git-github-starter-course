The tasks describe the lab objectives you need to complete. They usually include a series of checks which are run against your project to ensure each task has been completed. To verify you have fulfilled a specific task, select the grey box next to that task. If the box appears red, it means the task requirement was not fulfilled. A green box indicates a successfully completed task. If you want to check all the tasks at once, select Calculate Grade. This will provide you with an overview of your progress, completion status, and your current grade for all the tasks in the assignment. Select the Submit button at the bottom of the pane to send the grades to your instructor once you have sufficiently completed all tasks.

The live terminal is a real coding environment that allows you to build and run your program. To execute your code, simply select the Run code button located in the Instructional tab. The terminal will display the results of your code execution and enable you to interact with any input prompts as needed. If you do not see the terminal, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+` or if using a Mac command+` to launch or relaunch the terminal. You have the option to display terminals side by side. To do so, split a terminal to create a group by right clicking on the title tab. This feature enables you to divide the workspace and have multiple terminals within the same window, making it easier to manage and interact with different terminal instances. You can resize each terminal by dragging its edges and changing its position to the left, right, or bottom by pulling the tab to the desired location. This gives you the flexibility to customize the layout of your workspace according to your needs.

00:00:00.426 --> 00:00:03.336 A:middle
The live terminal is a
real coding environment

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:05.536 A:middle
that allows you to build
and run your program.

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.806 A:middle
To execute your code,

00:00:07.806 --> 00:00:11.076 A:middle
simply select the Run
code button located

00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:12.296 A:middle
in the Instructional tab.

00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:17.256 A:middle
The terminal will display the
results of your code execution

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:21.366 A:middle
and enable you to interact with
any input prompts as needed.

00:00:22.346 --> 00:00:27.496 A:middle
If you do not see the terminal,
use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+'

00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:32.656 A:middle
or if using a Mac command+' to
launch or relaunch the terminal.

00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:37.486 A:middle
You have the option to
display terminals side by side.

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:41.596 A:middle
To do so, split a
terminal to create a group

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:44.816 A:middle
by right clicking
on the title tab.

00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:47.836 A:middle
This feature enables you
to divide the workspace

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:51.216 A:middle
and have multiple terminals
within the same window,

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:54.436 A:middle
making it easier to
manage and interact

00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:56.306 A:middle
with different terminal
instances.

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:01.756 A:middle
You can resize each terminal
by dragging its edges

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:05.266 A:middle
and changing its position
to the left, right,

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:09.286 A:middle
or bottom by pulling the
tab to the desired location.

00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:14.146 A:middle
This gives you the flexibility
to customize the layout

00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:16.476 A:middle
of your workspace
according to your needs.

The Companion tab displays text, interactive tasks, and instructions to guide you through each project. It contains guidance for using the code editor; the required tasks for the assignment; and instructions for how to complete the assignment. It also includes an example output for the task. To run your code in the code editor, simply select the Run Code button. This will execute the code and show you the output while identifying any errors that may have occurred. To check if tasks have met the requirements, select the Calculate Grade button. If the tasks have been fulfilled, a green checkmark will appear. If the tasks have not been fulfilled, a red X will appear instead. Continue to refine, run, and calculate your code until you are satisfied with the outcome. To submit the assignment, select the Submit button.

This portion is the code editor. The code editor allows you to edit the files in your project. To access options, such as revealing a particular file in the Explorer, right-click the file tab. The code editor will enhance your coding experience with syntax highlighting and bracket auto completion and will allow you to easily indent or outdent your code. You can open multiple editors side by side, both vertically and horizontally. You can resize and reorder the editors as per your preference. To reposition or resize an editor, simply drag and drop the tab to the desired location.
